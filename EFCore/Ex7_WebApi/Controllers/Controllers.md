Attempting to work out workflow for Generating a DAL from an Ef Visual Designer

Installed Swashbuckle.AspNetCore

== ERROR WHEN CREATING CONTROLLERS  ==
Finding the generator 'minimalapi'...

Minimal hosting scenario!
Attempting to figure out the EntityFramework metadata for the model and DbContext: 'Student'

Unable to create an object of type 'CourseManagerModel'. For the different patterns supported at design time, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851728 StackTrace:
Unable to resolve service for type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContextOptions`1[Ex7_DAL.CourseManagerModel]' while attempting to activate 'Ex7_DAL.CourseManagerModel'.

== SOLUTION ==

Some of the EF Core Tools commands (for example, the Scaffolding commands) require a derived DbContext instance to be created at design time in order to gather details about the application's entity types and how they map to a database schema. 

In most cases, it is desirable that the DbContext thereby created is configured in a similar way to how it would be configured at run time.

The tools first try to obtain the service provider by invoking 

		Program.CreateHostBuilder(), 
		calling Build(), 
		then accessing the Services property.

Use a design-time factory, needs to be in DAL project (e.g Ex7_DAL), not in API project.

        using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design;
        using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
        
        namespace Ex7_DAL
        {
            public class ApplicationDbContextFactory : IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<CourseManagerModel>
            {
                public CourseManagerModel CreateDbContext(string[] args)
                {
                    var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<CourseManagerModel>();
                    optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(CourseManagerModel.ConnectionString);

                    return new CourseManagerModel();
                }
            }
        }


# Generating controllers can be done in various ways depending on your needs and preferences. 

Here are some common methods:

## Scaffolding feature in Visual Studio: 
This is the easiest way to generate controllers, especially if you are using Visual Studio. 

Right-click on the Controllers folder in your project, select "Add" > "New Scaffolded Item", and choose the "API Controller with actions, using Entity Framework" template. 

This will generate a fully functional CRUD controller for your model.

## "Add Controller" feature in Visual Studio: 
Another way to generate controllers is to use the "Add Controller" feature in Visual Studio. 

Right-click on the Controllers folder in your project, select "Add" > "Controller", choose the appropriate template (e.g. "API Controller - Empty"), and click "Add". 

This will generate a new controller file with some boilerplate code that you can customize.


## dotnet CLI: If you prefer using the command line, you can use the dotnet CLI to generate controllers. 

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command: dotnet add controller. 

This will prompt you to choose the appropriate template and other options.

## Create controllers manually: 

If you prefer to create controllers manually, you can simply create a new class file in the Controllers folder, 
inherit from the ControllerBase class or ApiController class (depending on whether you are using ASP.NET Core MVC or Web API), and add the appropriate action methods.

Regardless of which method you choose, make sure to follow the best practices for designing controllers, such as using the appropriate HTTP verbs, returning the appropriate HTTP status codes, and validating user input.
